# Gender Equality GDSC Project.

This project aims to promote gender equality and empower all women and girls through the use of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. We use the [google/flan-t5-base](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-base) model to analyze sentences and classify them as promoting gender equality or not.

# Demo

To try out the project, you can access our Gradio web app demo [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Karim-Gamal/Flan_T5_Gender_Equality_Classification). Simply enter a sentence in the input field and click "Classify" to see if it promotes gender equality or not.

# Video

We have also created an unlisted video on YouTube that provides a brief overview of the project and demonstrates how to use the Gradio web app. You can access the video here.


# Usage

If you would like to use the project for your own NLP tasks, you can clone this repository and modify the code to suit your needs. You will need to have Python installed, along with the `Transformers` and `Gradio` libraries.

To install the required libraries, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
pip install transformers gradio
```

You can then run the `Demo_app.py` file to start the Gradio web app and use the project for your own sentence classification tasks

# Contributing
